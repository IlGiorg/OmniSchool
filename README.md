## A School's All-in-One Solution

### Welcome to OmniSchool!
> “Everything for the School”

OmniSchool is an **open-source**, all-in-one online school management system that includes <ins>everything</ins> — from Homework to Accounting!

And best of all, it’s **100% customizable**:
- Don’t need a feature? **Remove it!**
- Need a new one? **Build it!**

That’s the beauty of open-source 🌱

## 🚀 Features

### 👩‍🏫 Teachers

Teachers are the core of education. OmniSchool offers a wide range of tools to support them.

#### 📋 Attendance
Teachers can select a class, take attendance, view attendance records, and **download a PDF** form list of students and their data.

> [!TIP] 
> Print the form list for field trips when carrying a laptop might be inconvenient!

#### ⚖️ Conduct
OmniSchool provides a **tiered conduct system**: *L0 to L5*.  
Each record requires a description to keep communication clear between teachers and families.

Customizable for any school’s needs — use only descriptions, adjust levels, or add new ones.

Positive behavior? Teachers can assign **House Points** too!

> [!NOTE]
> Don’t use Houses? Rename them to “Positive Points” in settings.

#### 📝 Grades
Teachers can grade assignments, view class or individual progress, and assign **Period Grades** that auto-fill student report cards.

#### 📚 Homework
Assign homework to one or multiple classes.  
Teachers can upload resource files with the assignment to support student learning.

#### 🧑‍🎓 Students Database
Browse the student database by class or individual students.  
📸 *Student photo support is planned for a future update!*

### 🛠️ Admin Panel

The hub for behind-the-scenes management:
- Create/edit students and teachers
- Execute raw SQL queries (with an extra password layer for safety)

🔐 Secure by design:  
The Admin Panel requires a dedicated additional account with a different password, plus a **second password** for SQL commands.

*More admin features coming soon!*

### 💼 Other Modules (Coming Soon)

- **Accounting**
- **Human Resources**
- **Reception**
- **Events Management**
